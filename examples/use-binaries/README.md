# Using binaries

This example shows how you can use the Snapshot tool by downloading the prebuilt binaries from the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/cognitedata/bazel-snapshots/releases).
The only thing you have to to in order to set this up is to import the snapshots repository and use `snapshots_repos()`
to set up the dependencies.
